# Fix The Factory 

Final year uni project - Fix the Factory
3D puzzle phyiscs based game created with Unreal Engine 5.2.1

Refacting features into C++ something to work on to furhter my C++ skills, especially considering how complex some of the systems are.

FOR CURRENT C++ WORK (Go to Source -> FinalYearProject -> 'Private' & 'Public') or (https://tinyurl.com/38mmvavx)
